# Implementation Summary: Issue #2 - Improve Notifications

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

This implementation delivers the enhanced notification system for the Cursor Active Users Bot, fulfilling all requirements from issue #2.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Individual DM Notifications**

- Users inactive for 60+ days (configurable) receive individual DMs in Slack
- Message: "You haven't used Cursor for {inactive_period} days. If you are planning to not use the app, please inform IT so we can remove the license."
- DMs are sent every week for users meeting the criteria
- Failed DMs are logged but don't stop execution

### 2. **Removal Candidates List**

- Users inactive for 90+ days (configurable) are listed as removal candidates
- Admin receives a summary notification with all candidates
- Admin notification always sends (even if DMs failed) and errors are logged

### 3. **Weekly Schedule**

- Changed from monthly to weekly execution
- Runs every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- Configurable timing through CDK infrastructure

### 4. **Configurable Time Periods**

- `NOTIFY_AFTER_DAYS` environment variable (default: 60 days)
- `REMOVE_AFTER_DAYS` environment variable (default: 90 days)
- No hardcoded time periods - all configurable

### 5. **Generic Naming Convention**

- `usersToNotify` instead of time-specific names
- `usersToRemove` instead of time-specific names
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### **Service Layer Updates**

```
src/services/inactive-users-analyzer.ts
├── New: categorizeInactiveUsers() 
├── New: CategorizedInactiveUsers interface
├── Updated: getUsageDataDateRange() - now accepts days
└── Enhanced: Generic naming and configurable periods
```

```
src/services/slack-api.ts
├── New: sendInactivityWarningDM() - individual DMs
├── New: sendRemovalCandidatesNotification() - admin notification
└── Enhanced: Better error handling and logging
```

### **Lambda Handler**

```
src/lambda/index.ts
├── New: Environment variable configuration
├── New: Parallel DM sending with success/failure tracking
├── New: Robust error handling for admin notifications
└── Enhanced: Detailed logging and execution summary
```

### **Infrastructure**

```
lib/cursor-active-users-bot-stack.ts
├── Updated: Weekly scheduling (Monday 9 AM UTC)
├── New: Environment variables for time periods
├── Increased: Memory (512MB) and timeout (5 minutes)
└── New: Schedule information output
```

## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### **Unit Tests Added**

- `categorizeInactiveUsers()` function tests
- `sendInactivityWarningDM()` tests (success/failure scenarios)
- `sendRemovalCandidatesNotification()` tests
- Infrastructure tests updated for weekly schedule
- All existing tests updated for day-based configuration

### **Test Scenarios Covered**

- Users in different activity states
- Failed DM sending scenarios  
- Empty user lists
- Configuration validation
- Infrastructure resource verification

## 📋 Configuration Guide

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
NOTIFY_AFTER_DAYS=60    # Days after which users get DM notifications
REMOVE_AFTER_DAYS=90    # Days after which users are removal candidates
```

### **Deployment Configuration**

```bash
# In CDK stack environment variables (lib/cursor-active-users-bot-stack.ts)
NOTIFY_AFTER_DAYS: "60"
REMOVE_AFTER_DAYS: "90"
```

## 🚀 Deployment Changes

### **Infrastructure Updates**

- **Schedule**: Weekly (Monday 9:00 AM UTC) vs. previous monthly
- **Memory**: 512MB vs. previous 256MB  
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes vs. previous 1 minute
- **Environment**: Added configurable time period variables

### **Resource Impact**

- More frequent execution (weekly vs monthly)
- Higher memory allocation for better performance
- Longer timeout to handle individual DM processing

## 📊 Execution Flow

```
1. Lambda triggered weekly (Monday 9 AM UTC)
2. Fetch team members from Cursor API
3. Get usage data for both notification and removal periods
4. Categorize users into usersToNotify and usersToRemove
5. Send individual DMs to usersToNotify (parallel processing)
6. Send removal candidates notification to admin
7. Log execution summary with counts and status
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

### **Log Outputs**

- Configuration values at start
- Usage data fetch summaries  
- User categorization results
- DM sending progress (success/failure counts)
- Admin notification status
- Final execution summary

### **Error Handling**

- Individual DM failures don't stop execution
- Admin notification failures are logged but don't fail the lambda
- Detailed error information in CloudWatch logs

## ✅ Issue Requirements Met

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 2-month DM notifications | ✅ | Configurable `NOTIFY_AFTER_DAYS` (default 60) |
| 3-month removal list | ✅ | Configurable `REMOVE_AFTER_DAYS` (default 90) |
| Weekly checks | ✅ | EventBridge rule for Monday 9 AM UTC |
| Recurring DM notifications | ✅ | Every weekly execution sends DMs |
| Admin always gets notification | ✅ | Robust error handling ensures delivery |
| Configurable time periods | ✅ | Environment variables in days |
| Generic naming | ✅ | `usersToNotify`, `usersToRemove` |
| No storage needed | ✅ | Stateless operation each execution |

## 🎉 Ready for Production

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for deployment. All requirements from issue #2 have been fulfilled with a robust, maintainable, and well-tested solution.
